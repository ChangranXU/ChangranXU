👋 Hi there! I’m Changran Xu

I’m a Computer Science and Engineering student at **CUHK**. My passion lies in exploring **LLMs, machine learning, and computer vision**. I love working on projects that push the boundaries of AI and enhance real-world applications.

🌱 Currently, I am focusing on:
- **LLM for Code**: Building models to improve code generation and understanding.
- **LLM for Verification**: Ensuring the reliability of AI-generated code.
- **GNN (Graph Neural Networks)**: Applying graph-based methods to enhance model performance.
- **Multimodal AI**: Integrating diverse data types for richer, more comprehensive models.
- **Efficient and Affordable LLM**: Optimizing models to reduce costs while maintaining high performance.
